Antibody can manage plugins for shells (`zsh`, for example), both loading them
with `source` or `export`-ing them to `PATH`.


### Why?

I was using Antigen before. It is a good plugin manager, but at the same time
it's bloated and slow - 5+ seconds to load on my Mac... that's way too
much to wait for a prompt to load!

Antibody is focused on performance, and, since v2.0.0, it manages more than just
ZSH plugins, but also PATH plugins (those project with binaries) and it is easy
enough to implement it for Fish and others.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/119201.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/119201)

I'm aware that there are other attempts, like
[antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs), but I don't want to
install a lot of dependencies for this to work.

### Why Go

Well, the compiled Go program runs anywhere and doesn't depend on any shared
libraries. I also don't need to source it as it would be necessary with
plain simple shell. I also can do things in parallel with Go routines.

### What works

These are the only antigen commands I ever used:

- `bundle`
- `update`
- `apply`

Antibody does just those three things, but you don't even need to `apply`.
Running `antibody bundle` will already download and apply the given bundle.

`antibody home` also shows where the repositories are being downloaded.

### What doesn't work

- The `theme` command (although most themes might just work with `bundle`);
- oh-my-zsh support: it looks very ugly to me and I won't do it;

### Install

The simplest way to install Antibody is to run:

```console
$ curl -sL https://git.io/antibody | bash -s
$ echo 'source <(antibody init)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

This will put the binary in `/usr/local/bin/antibody` and setup your `~/.zshrc`
to load what is needed on startup.

You can also use homebrew (on macOS):

```console
$ brew install getantibody/tap/antibody
```

Or even using [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/antibody/) on Arch Linux.

### Usage

Now, you can just `antibody bundle` stuff, e.g.,
`antibody bundle caarlos0/jvm`. The repository will be cloned at
your OS cache folder (check `antibody home`) folder.

The ZSH bundle implementation will try to load files that match:

- `*.plugin.zsh`
- `*.zsh`
- `*.sh`
- `*.zsh-theme`

The Path bundle implementation will just add the folder to your `PATH`.

You can change the implementation by adding `kind:zsh` or `kind:path` to the
argument, as in `antibody bundle 'caarlos0/ports kind:path'`

You can also specify a branch to download, for example,
`antibody bundle caarlos0/jvm branch:v2` will download the `v2` branch of that
repository.

When you decide to update your bundles, just run `antibody update`: it will
update all bundles inside the `antibody home` folder.

### Protips

Prefer to use it like this:

```sh
$ cat plugins.txt
caarlos0/jvm
caarlos0/ports kind:path
djui/alias-tips
caarlos0/zsh-mkc
zsh-users/zsh-completions
caarlos0/zsh-open-github-pr
zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search

$ antibody bundle < plugins.txt
```

This way antibody can concurrently clone the bundles and return the shell
line, so it will probably be faster than call each one separately.
