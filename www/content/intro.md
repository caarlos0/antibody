Antibody is a shell plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about
performance.

It is faster because it can do things concurrently, while Antigen does it
sequentially. It also has the advantage of using a compiled language instead
of a scripting one.

You can see it working in the below example:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/4BUL2JSCF41ccllqU0FExQ83A.js" id="asciicast-4BUL2JSCF41ccllqU0FExQ83A" async></script>
